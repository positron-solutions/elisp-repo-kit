;;; Commentary:

;; Set up Emacs package with Gihub repository configuration, complete with
;; Actions CI, tests, lints, and a licensing scheme all ready to go.  Included
;; commands are focused on productivity, appropriate for professional
;; development in elisp.  The goal of the package is streamline authoring &
;; distributing new Emacs packages.  It provides a well-integrated but rigid
;; scheme, aka opinionated.
;;
;; The package also uses its own hosted source as a substrate for creating new
;; packages.  It will clone its source respository and then perform renaming &
;; relicensing.  Simply call `erk-new' to start a new package.  The
;; README documents remaining setup steps on GitHub and in preparation for
;; publishing on MELPA.
;;
;; As a development aid, the package is versatile enough to work on some elisp
;; packages that were not descended from its own source.  The scope of
;; functionality is primarily to interface with linting and testing frameworks,
;; both in batch and interactive workflows.

;;; Code:

;; see flake.nix for providing dependencies for CI and local development.
